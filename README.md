# What the application is about
🧠 Problem it Solves:

Many qualified candidates are filtered out by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) because their resumes lack the specific keywords listed in job descriptions. This tool helps job seekers optimize their resumes to match job postings and increase their chances of getting noticed.

⚙️ What It Does:

Takes a resume and a job description as input.

Extracts keywords and key phrases (skills, tools, action verbs, titles).

Compares the two and highlights missing keywords in the resume.

Displays results in a clean, interactive UI.
